Respected Sir/Ma'am I can't install Sql Management Software So I have done the Hand on the MYSql.



-- Step 1: Drop table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;

-- Step 2: Create the Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Step 3: Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price)
VALUES
(1, 'iPhone 15', 'Smartphones', 1200),
(2, 'Galaxy S23', 'Smartphones', 1100),
(3, 'Pixel 8', 'Smartphones', 1100),
(4, 'Nokia G20', 'Smartphones', 200),
(5, 'Dell XPS 15', 'Laptops', 2000),
(6, 'MacBook Air', 'Laptops', 1800),
(7, 'HP Pavilion', 'Laptops', 1800),
(8, 'Lenovo IdeaPad', 'Laptops', 1200);

-- Step 4: Show all ranking functions
SELECT 
    ProductID,
    ProductName,
    Category,
    Price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RowNum,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RankNum,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS DenseRankNum
FROM Products;

-- Step 5: Top 3 using ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RowNum
    FROM Products
) AS Ranked
WHERE RowNum <= 3;

-- Step 6: Top 3 using RANK()
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RankNum
    FROM Products
) AS Ranked
WHERE RankNum <= 3;

-- Step 7: Top 3 using DENSE_RANK()
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS DenseRankNum
    FROM Products
) AS Ranked
WHERE DenseRankNum <= 3;
